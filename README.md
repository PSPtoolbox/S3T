A tool to segment and analyze high troughput screen recordings of electronically stimulated synapses.

Some examples to get you started will be created in the future:

For now start with: **segGUIV1.m** for a GUI start

and 

**createSpineMovie.m**: To create artificial 96-well plate recordings.
(You will need ImageJ pre-installed for the creation of tiff movie files from the *.png files.)
and Matlab to run the code.

(Precompiled binaries available in the future.)
