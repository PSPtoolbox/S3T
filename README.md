A tool to segment and analyse high throughput screen recordings of electronically stimulated synapses.

Some examples to get you started will be created in the future:

and 

**createSpineMovie.m**: To create artificial 96-well plate recordings.
You need Matlab to run the code.

To run analysis:
1) Disable the load analysis check-box 
2) Enter 30,3,0.2 and 15 in the respective fields. 
3) Press that Big red button Proc. Dir.
